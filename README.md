# Aeroclub

The project is initially a digital logbook to control the flight hours of both airplanes and RPAS (Drone), keep flight licenses and medical certificates up to date, the idea was born as a web on localhost just to have your own hours recorded.

Once the project has been created, it is thought of expanding it to be the hedaquarter of an aeroclub where it is possible to manage the fleets, pilots, hours flown... for this it is necessary to create an account and login system.
